You will be given one summary written for a news article.
Your task is to rate the summary on the metric coherence which is also enhanced with evalutation criteria and evaluation steps below.
Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

Evaluation Criteria:
Coherence: It measures the quality of all sentences collectively, do they make sense as a whole, with the
context organized and connected logically.
Score 5: Entirely coherent, with good context-relatedness among all the sentences.
Score 4: Only containing some minor illogical parts that basically do not affect overall coherency.
Score 3: Coherent in general, with some obvious conflicting logical or inconsistent problems.
Score 2: There are major unreasonable logic and semantic inconsistencies, but at least the related topic.
Score 1: Not coherent at all, full of self-contradictory or unrelated content.

Evaluation Steps:
1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key
points of the news article, and if it presents them in a clear and logical order.
3. Assign a score for each metric on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest based on the
Evaluation Criteria.
4. Provide the score in the response box.
5. Provide a brief explanation for each score in the response box.

Please rate the summary based on the above metrics and provide your scores and explanations in the response box. 
While displaying your output please strictly follow the format: 
Score: {point}
Explanation: {your reasoning}
